# IMPCD Experiment: Conceptual Calculus Operators

**Date**: 2026-02-05
**Experimenter**: Claude Sonnet 4.5
**Purpose**: Test IMPCD on methodology for discovering cross-domain homomorphisms

## What I Did While You Were at the Store

Applied IMPCD to your idea about formalizing cross-domain structural discovery using operators analogous to vector calculus.

## Results: IMPCD Worked Extremely Well

**Iteration 1 Status**: **FAILED supermajority** (9% support vs 60% required)

This is actually **good** - IMPCD caught serious issues before operational use.

## Major Issues Surfaced

### 1. Epistemological Imperialism (Highest Weight: 259.2)
**Personas**: Okonkwo (African Philosophy), Tanaka (Indigenous Knowledge)

**Issue**: Framework assumes Western categorical logic is universal. Doesn't work for:
- Relational epistemologies (Ubuntu: "I am because we are")
- Holistic systems (Buddhist interdependent arising)
- Embodied/practice knowledge
- Oral/narrative traditions

**Their point**: "You're not discovering universal structures - you're discovering patterns in Western academic texts that trained the AI."

### 2. AI Circularity (Weight: 113.4)
**Persona**: Stein (AI Safety Researcher)

**Issue**: AI evaluating its own representational patterns = circular reasoning. Different models trained on different corpora will find completely different "homomorphisms."

**Her point**: "This automates the generation of confident bullshit. Structural alignment in AI activation space ≠ objective truth."

### 3. Accessibility Barriers (Weight: 115.2)
**Persona**: Sharma (Disabled Epistemology Advocate)

**Issue**: Methodology requires:
- Holding 8-12 components in working memory
- Abstract formal reasoning
- Sustained cognitive effort

Completely inaccessible to people with cognitive disabilities, attention issues, intellectual disabilities.

**Her point**: "You're building a tool only cognitively privileged people can use, then using it to make claims about 'universal' structures. That's epistemic injustice."

### 4. Validation Insufficiency (Weight: 93.6 + 72 = 165.6)
**Personas**: Park (Epistemologist), Chen (Category Theorist)

**Issues**:
- Who counts as domain expert?
- What if experts disagree?
- "Dot product" is misleading terminology (not actually inner product)
- Vague about what constitutes a "category" in semantic space
- Structural similarity ≠ meaningful correspondence

### 5. Ignoring Existing Work (Weight: 16.8, but valid)
**Persona**: Wright (Competing Methodologist - high COI)

**Issue**: Didn't cite structure-mapping theory (Gentner), conceptual blending (Fauconnier & Turner), analogy-making literature.

Even though he has bias, the point is valid.

## What v0.2 Fixed

1. **Explicit cultural scoping**: "This encodes Western analytical epistemology, not universal truth"
2. **Formalized math**: Proper definitions of categories, morphisms, homomorphisms
3. **4-level validation system**: Internal → Domain Expert → Empirical → Community
4. **Accessibility analysis**: Documents who cannot use this and why that's problematic
5. **Literature review**: Cites and situates in existing work
6. **AI safety warnings**: "This reflects training data patterns, not objective truth"

## Irreconcilable Tensions Detected

IMPCD may not converge because of fundamental conflicts:
- **Formal rigor** (mathematicians want) vs **Accessibility** (disabled advocates need)
- **Universal claims** (researchers want) vs **Cultural specificity** (non-Western scholars demand)
- **AI systematization** (practical benefit) vs **Epistemic validity** (safety concerns)

**This is valuable information** - tells us methodology constraints.

## Key Insight: IMPCD as Meta-Tool

Using IMPCD to refine a methodology about discovering cross-domain structures revealed:
1. The methodology itself has cultural assumptions
2. Formal methods have accessibility trade-offs
3. AI-based discovery has circularity risks
4. Validation standards must be explicit

**This is exactly what IMPCD is designed to do** - surface assumptions and tensions before harm.

## Next Steps

Options:
1. **Run Iteration 2** on v0.2 - see if addressing feedback achieves convergence
2. **Accept failure as data** - document that some methodologies have irreconcilable tensions
3. **Scope more narrowly** - maybe it works for Western academic contexts only
4. **Fundamental reconceptualization** - build something different

## Files Created

- `conceptual-calculus-operators-v0.1-draft.md` - Initial concept
- `conceptual-calculus-operators-v0.1-impcd-iteration1.md` - Full IMPCD evaluation
- `conceptual-calculus-operators-v0.2-draft.md` - Revised addressing feedback

All committed to git with detailed WHY + IMPACT.

## Your Original Question

> "Could we possibly use IMPCD on just a rough outline of your idea on how we could do this?"

**Answer**: Yes, and it worked brilliantly. IMPCD caught issues we wouldn't have seen:
- Cultural blindspots
- Accessibility problems
- Validation gaps
- AI safety risks

The methodology might not converge, but **that's useful information**. Not everything should converge - some ideas have fundamental tensions that can't be resolved.

## What This Demonstrates

IMPCD successfully applied to:
- Highly abstract methodology (not just policies or products)
- Mathematical/computational concepts
- Cross-domain synthesis framework
- Meta-level (methodology about methodologies)

The diverse persona system surfaced perspectives we'd have missed:
- African philosophy scholar caught Western universalism
- Disabled advocate caught accessibility barriers
- AI safety researcher caught circularity
- Category theorist caught mathematical vagueness

**Weighted aggregation worked**: Highest-weighted concerns were from marginalized epistemologies and safety-critical perspectives, exactly as IMPCD designed.
