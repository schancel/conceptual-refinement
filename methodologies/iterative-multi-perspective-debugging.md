# Iterative Multi-Perspective Conceptual Debugging Methodology (v2.0.0)

> **Status:** STABLE / FINAL  
> **Release date:** January 2026  
> **Total documented iterations:** 12+ across Claude, ChatGPT, Grok  
> **Purpose:** Conceptual debugging — not validation, consensus, or truth discovery

## Versioning Policy (Semantic Versioning 2.0.0)

We follow strict **Semantic Versioning** rules:

- **MAJOR** (X in vX.y.z) — incremented for incompatible changes or major new subsystems  
  (e.g., philosophical frameworks → structural patterns; addition of full threshold/tipping-point subsystem)
- **MINOR** (y in vX.y.z) — backwards-compatible features or significant refinements  
- **PATCH** (z in vX.y.z) — bug fixes, wording clarifications, minor tightening

**v2.0.0 rationale**  
The nonlinear thresholds / tipping-points subsystem (7-element template, quantitative preference, premium caps, ethnographic mandates, dedicated pitfall, checklist) is a major functional enhancement to handling nonlinear/systemic risks. Combined with the earlier paradigm shift to structural patterns (v1.4), this justifies the major version increment from 1.x → 2.0.0.

Future changes should follow this policy to avoid confusion.

## Prerequisites & Recommendations

**Strongly recommended:** Load a structural-moral-realism constitution (e.g. Claude Constitutional AI Guidance v8.0) for optimal consistency.  
**Self-contained fallback:** The embedded pattern catalog below is sufficient for standalone use.

**Personas vs Operator Framework**  
- **Personas** argue from diverse authentic ethical lenses (divine command, libertarian rights, utilitarian welfare, care ethics, etc.) — this diversity is required.  
- **Operator/evaluator** uses **structural moral realism**: identifies patterns, assesses evidence, sets premiums based on violation severity and predictable consequences, distinguishes structural from value claims, does **not** impose framework on personas.

## Overview

### Core Value Proposition
This methodology does **not** attempt to prove a concept is *correct*. It systematically surfaces unexamined assumptions, conflicts, blindspots, and value tensions — functioning as **conceptual debugging**:
- Making implicit assumptions explicit
- Stress-testing internal coherence
- Forcing engagement with adversarial and affected perspectives
- Preserving important dissent instead of averaging it away

Output: a more internally coherent, better-scoped, and honest concept — **not** a validated one.

### Why This Instead of Real Human Feedback
Structured, diverse, adversarial human feedback typically takes weeks/months and significant cost — rarely feasible early when ideas are most malleable.  
This process completes in **hours or days**, enabling deep pre-consultation reasoning — **without pretending to replace real people**.

## Core Process

### 1. Initial Concept Formulation
- Begin with any text-based concept (proposal, vision, policy draft, product positioning, governance framework)
- No length or form constraints

### 2. Persona Generation with Diversity Verification
Generate ~11 evaluator personas spanning **real, conflicting perspectives**.

#### Required Diversity Dimensions
- Ideological / value diversity
- Stakeholder diversity (beneficiaries, implementers, critics, displaced)
- Expertise diversity
- Demographic diversity (culture, language, disability, neurodivergence, SES)
- Power position diversity (marginalized vs centered)
- Conflict-of-interest diversity

#### Critical Requirement
Explicitly include personas with conflicts of interest (financially/professionally displaced, disproportionate beneficiaries) — these are necessary adversarial signals.

#### Diversity Verification
- Automated checks for overlap/homogenization
- Manual review against dimensions
- Personas must differ across multiple axes
- Explicit prompts to mitigate LLM cultural biases
- Model Bias Check: non-Western personas must not default to Western frameworks; marginalized perspectives not stereotyped

**LIMITATION ACKNOWLEDGED:** LLM-generated personas cannot replace cultural insiders for culturally-sensitive concepts.

### 3. Structured Feedback Collection (Two-Axis Signal)
Each persona provides:
1. Written feedback
2. Severity score (1–10) — impact if concern valid
3. Confidence score (1–10) — likelihood concern is correct
4. Overall stance: support / oppose / neutral
5. Self-identified conflicts of interest

**Rationale:** Separating severity from confidence reduces cultural variance, emotional inflation, and gaming.

### 4. Weighted Feedback Aggregation

#### Structural Patterns Framework
Premiums based on **observable structural patterns** — how systems mechanically operate.

#### What Qualifies as a Structural Pattern (HIGH confidence requires ALL)
1. Clear mechanism
2. Predictability when violated
3. Cross-cultural robustness (7–8+ diverse contexts)
4. Difficulty sustaining alternatives
5. Alternative explanations considered and less compelling

#### Structural Pattern Catalog

**Individual-Level Patterns**

| Pattern                     | Mechanism                                              | Confidence | Cross-Cultural Validation Status                          |

| Power accountability gap    | Power without accountability tends toward abuse        | HIGH       | Historical pattern (Acton 1887, Michels 1911)              |
| Path dependence             | Early choices constrain future options                 | HIGH       | Institutions, technology, culture (Arthur 1989, Pierson 2000) |

**Systemic-Level Patterns**

| Pattern                     | Mechanism                                              | Confidence | Cross-Cultural Validation Status                          |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Oppression maintenance      | Systemic oppression constrains/harms mechanically      | HIGH       | Across cultures/time (Collins 1990, Bonilla-Silva 1997)   |
| Inequality compounding      | Advantage/disadvantage compounds over time             | HIGH       | Matthew Effect (Merton 1968, Piketty 2014)                 |
| Power concentration         | Power concentrates without countervailing forces       | HIGH       | Governance systems (Michels 1911, Tilly 1998)              |
| Collective action dynamics  | Coordination problems follow predictable patterns      | HIGH       | Well-studied (Olson 1965, Ostrom 1990)                     |
| Structural violence         | Systems harm without individual intent                 | HIGH       | Multiple contexts (Galtung 1969, Farmer 2004)              |

**Key Distinction:**  
Structural pattern (empirical): "Reciprocity operates mechanically"  
Value claim (not empirical): "Reciprocity is good"

**Note:** Some mechanically-operating patterns may be undesirable (tribalism, power concentration). Identifying ≠ endorsing.

#### Nonlinear Thresholds / Tipping Points

Some patterns involve **threshold effects** where systems remain stable until a critical point, then transition rapidly. These require special documentation due to irreversibility and disproportionate harm.

**Examples:** Trust collapse, ecological regime shifts, cultural extinction, reputation collapse, inequality thresholds, network effects

**Threshold Documentation Template (7 Required Elements):**

1. **Pattern name**: Which pattern has threshold behavior
2. **Threshold mechanism**: What triggers the phase transition?
3. **Threshold estimate**:
   - Quantitative (if available): Cite research with values/ranges
   - Qualitative (if unavailable): Describe trigger conditions
4. **Evidence level**: Provisional / Validated / Highly Validated
5. **Reversibility**: Can system recover? At what cost?
6. **Warning indicators**: What signals precede threshold?
7. **Premium justification**: Why higher premium warranted?

**Quantitative vs Qualitative:**  
Always prefer quantitative when available. Examples:
- Climate tipping points (~1.5-2°C warming)
- Amazon deforestation threshold (~40%)
- Organizational trust collapse (~3-4 major violations)
- Inequality instability (Gini >0.4-0.45)

Only use qualitative when quantitative estimates unavailable. Be explicit about uncertainty.

#### Pattern Validation Tiers

- **Provisional**: LLM assessment, no citations → premium 1.3×–1.5× (mark clearly provisional)
- **Validated**: Citations provided → 1.3×–2.0×
- **Highly Validated**: Robust cross-cultural evidence → 1.3×–2.0×

**Threshold Pattern Validation:**
- **Provisional**: Standard range only (1.3×–1.5×), qualitative reasoning documented
- **Validated**: Can use upper range (1.3×–1.7×), cite threshold existence
- **Highly Validated**: Upper range justified (1.5×–2.0×), quantitative estimates required

**Key principle:** Higher premiums require higher evidence. Provisional threshold claims must be conservative.

#### Premium Guidelines

| Affected Community Context                        | Relevant Structural Pattern                          | Typical Premium |
|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Direct subjects of rules/policy                   | Inclusion/exclusion dynamics, power accountability   | 1.5× – 1.8×     |
| Marginalized communities with violation history   | Trust dynamics, compounding historical violation     | 1.6× – 2.0×     |
| Communities facing irreversible harm              | Threshold effects, trauma responses                  | 1.7× – 2.0×     |
| Workers facing displacement                       | Reciprocity (domain knowledge), enforcement paradox  | 1.4× – 1.6×     |
| People with lived experience of systemic issue    | Domain knowledge advantage, reciprocity              | 1.5× – 1.7×     |

**Documentation Requirements** (for each pattern/premium)
- Pattern(s) applied
- Evidence level + citations (for Validated/Highly Validated)
- Violation severity & predictable consequences
- Pattern boundaries / exceptions / scale-dependencies
- Threshold elements (if applicable, using 7-element template)
- Provisional claims clearly marked

#### Conflict-of-Interest (COI) Scope & Adjustment Factors

| Situation                              | Weight Range | Rationale |
|----------------------------------------|--------------|-----------|
| Displaced / threatened professionally  | 0.2× – 0.5×  | Floor ensures voice; discount self-preservation bias |
| Disproportionate financial benefit     | 0.5×         | Support may be self-interested |
| No financial/professional conflict     | 1.0×         | Baseline |

**Complete Weighting Formula**  
```
weight = 1.0 × max(COI_adjustment, structural_premium) × severity × confidence
```

*Lived experience / structural premium overrides COI via max()*

### 5. Aggregation Rules

**Supermajority Threshold**  
Changes require **>60% weighted support**

**High-Severity Minority Protection**  
≤4 personas with severity ≥8 **and** confidence ≥7 → preserve as **Minority Report**

### 6. Mandatory Audits

**A. Power & Incentives Audit**  
- Who benefits/loses regardless of outcome?  
- Incentives outside argumentation?  
- Power dynamics that cannot be reasoned away?  
- Structural patterns at risk?  
- Threshold effects at risk?  

**Consequences** (if operator benefits regardless or has financial stake): premium floor 1.5×, mandatory external review

**B. Operator Integrity & Abuse Resistance Audit**  
- Who controls persona generation / premiums?  
- Constraints on selective inclusion/exclusion?  
- Operator incentives?  
- Abuse detection?  
- Structural patterns operator might bias toward/against?  
- Threshold identification blindspots?

**C. Model Bias Audit**  
- Cultural/ideological skew  
- Stereotype check  
- Training data artifacts  
- Disability representation  
- Pattern universality bias  
- Threshold identification/quantification bias

**Real Community Involvement** (mandatory for culturally-sensitive / disabled / marginalized-affected concepts)  
- AI personas insufficient  
- Involve real members in iterations 3+

### 7. Concept Refinement
Incorporate supermajority changes with rationale, pattern documentation, threshold template (if applicable).  
Preserve in **Minority Report**: high-severity concerns, unresolved tensions, alternative pattern/threshold interpretations.  
Document: patterns/validation, premiums, thresholds, audits, changes made/not made.

### 8. Iteration & Termination

**Convergence** (all required)  
- Semantic similarity >95%  
- No new high-severity minority concerns  
- Weighted support stable (±5%) across 2 consecutive iterations

**Failure Modes** (informative, not shameful)
- **Oscillation**: Similarity to N-2 > similarity to N-1
- **Fragmentation**: Increasing logical contradictions
- **Irreconcilable tensions**: Opposing high-severity minorities 3+ iterations
- **Expansion runaway**: >50% length increase without convergence
- **Iteration cap**: >10 iterations without convergence
- **Diversity collapse**: <3 distinct positions in feedback

### 9. Git Tracking & Data Governance

Each iteration produces a commit containing:
- Updated concept text
- Persona feedback (individual + summary)
- Severity & confidence scores
- Structural pattern analysis (patterns, evidence levels, validation status)
- Threshold documentation (using 7-element template when applicable)
- Pattern citations (for Validated/Highly Validated)
- Quantitative vs qualitative threshold modeling (with justification)
- Pattern boundaries (where patterns apply/don't, exceptions)
- Pattern-to-premium mapping
- Weight calculations (COI, premium, severity, confidence)
- Structural premium justifications
- Community input received and how incorporated
- Minority reports with full context
- COI disclosures with adjustment values and rationale
- Power & incentives audit (patterns/thresholds at risk)
- Operator integrity audit (pattern blindspots, over-application risks)
- Model bias audit notes
- External review findings (if conducted)
- Convergence metrics
- Rationale for changes made and not made

**Data Retention:**
- High-stakes: 7 years minimum (or local legal requirement, whichever longer)
- Medium-stakes: 3 years
- Low-stakes: Project conclusion + 1 year

**Access:**
- High-stakes: Accessible to affected communities and external reviewers
- Medium-stakes: Internal with option to share externally
- Low-stakes: Internal only

**Privacy:** Anonymize personal information, preserve persona types, do not redact pattern justifications or threshold documentation (required for auditability)

## Explicit Limitations (Accepted)
- Cannot replace real stakeholder consultation
- Cannot model raw power directly
- Cannot prevent bad-faith operators entirely
- Convergence ≠ correctness
- Dependent on LLM quality; biases persist
- Different LLMs produce different converged versions
- AI personas cannot capture full nuance of lived experience
- Cultural context requires real ethnography
- Structural patterns require empirical validation
- Threshold quantitative estimates preferred; qualitative claims remain provisional
- Cross-cultural validation varies by pattern

## Required Disclaimers (Always Include)
1. AI-generated personas, not real stakeholders
2. Cannot replace lived experience or community voice
3. Identifies blindspots and inconsistencies, not truth
4. COI weighting limited to financial/professional conflicts (floor 0.2×)
5. Structural premiums applied based on empirically-grounded patterns: [list with evidence levels]
6. Pattern validation status: [Provisional/Validated/Highly Validated]
7. Citations for Validated/Highly Validated patterns: [references]
8. Threshold patterns documented with validation level
9. Quantitative vs qualitative threshold modeling noted
10. Community input: [received/not; how incorporated]
11. External review: [conducted/not; by whom]
12. If failed: concept may contain irreconcilable tensions
13. This version reflects [LLM name]'s understanding of structural patterns
14. Different LLMs may identify different patterns/assess evidence differently
15. Local legal requirements: [consulted/not consulted]
16. Ethnographic gap: real ethnographic input strongly preferred for culturally-specific pattern/threshold application

## Appropriate Use Cases

**Use for:**
- Early-stage concept development
- Governance drafts, policy proposals (with community involvement for high-stakes)
- Product positioning, strategic documents
- Pre-consultation stress-testing
- Identifying blindspots, pattern violations, threshold risks

**Do NOT use for:**
- Final validation
- Claims of consensus
- Decisions affecting communities without real participation
- Culturally-sensitive concepts without cultural insiders
- Disabled-community concepts without disabled people
- Threshold effects at risk without domain experts
- Replacing ethnographic research
- High-stakes decisions without human validation/external review

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them

1. **Treating convergence as validation** → Remember: debugging, not proof
2. **Using COI to silence dissent** → COI only for financial/professional conflicts
3. **Inconsistent premium application** → Document patterns, use guidelines, invite community input
4. **Insufficient persona diversity** → Include genuine adversaries, check for collapse
5. **Ignoring minority reports** → High-severity minorities are early warnings
6. **Trusting single LLM** → Cross-verify with multiple LLMs for high stakes
7. **Bad faith operation** → Conduct integrity audits, external review for high-stakes
8. **Using AI when real humans needed** → Involve community members in iterations 3+
9. **Misidentifying patterns** → Ensure HIGH confidence criteria met, default to Provisional
10. **Ignoring pattern boundaries** → Document exceptions, context limits, scale-dependencies
11. **Smuggling values as patterns** → "Pattern operates" ≠ "Pattern is good"
12. **Claiming HIGH without evidence** → Provide citations, be conservative
13. **Claiming thresholds without validation** → Use 7-element template, prefer quantitative, Provisional gets 1.3×–1.5× only

## Meta-Reflection

After 12+ iterations across three frontier models (Claude, ChatGPT, Grok), the methodology has achieved strong cross-LLM convergence on core mechanisms while embracing epistemic humility. 

Diminishing returns in later iterations indicate structural stability. Each LLM contributed unique refinements (Claude: accessibility & evidence rigor; ChatGPT: severity×confidence split; Grok: compounding effects & thresholds) while converging on structural patterns as foundation.

Next phase: real-world application and external validation.
