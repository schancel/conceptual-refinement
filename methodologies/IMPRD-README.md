# IMPRD Quick Start Guide

**Iterative Multi-Perspective Rhetorical Debugging (IMPRD) v1.0.0**

*Optimize your written communication through simulated diverse reader perspectives*

---

## What is IMPRD?

IMPRD helps you improve blog posts, articles, and persuasive content by simulating how diverse readers (from enthusiastic supporters to skeptical critics, from accessibility-needs readers to domain experts) will experience your writing.

**Result:** Surface clarity gaps, accessibility barriers, persuasion failures, and voice erosion before you publish.

## When to Use IMPRD

### ✅ Good Use Cases
- Important blog posts where reach matters
- Persuasive content on complex/controversial topics
- Content for diverse audiences beyond your bubble
- Pre-launch optimization before stakeholder review

### ❌ When NOT to Use
- Quick takes or personal journals (LOW-stakes)
- Time-sensitive content (just ship it)
- Content you've already tested with real users
- HIGH-stakes requiring real user testing (policy, health, vulnerable audiences)

### ⏱️ Time Investment
- Short post (800 words): 30-60 min per iteration, typically 2-3 iterations
- Long post (2500 words): 1-2 hours per iteration

## 10-Step Process (Quick Reference)

### 1. 🚨 Manipulation & Ethics Audit (VETO POWER)
**STOP if:**
- False/misleading claims
- Exploiting fear/outrage
- Content ABOUT marginalized communities without community review

**Check:** Is this legitimate emotional appeal or manipulation?

### 2. 📋 Document Content Goals
- Primary message (one sentence)
- Target audience (specific, not "general public")
- Intended action
- Author's authentic voice (what makes it distinctive?)

### 3. 👥 Generate 11 Diverse Reader Personas
**Required diversity:**
- Engagement: Enthusiastic supporter, skeptic, hostile critic, skimmer, deep reader
- Audience: Target insider, adjacent, complete outsider, non-native English speaker
- Accessibility: ADHD, dyslexia, limited literacy, D/deaf, autistic (1.5× weight)
- Social: High-status sharer, everyday reader, professional, affected stakeholder
- Values: Ideological/demographic differences, conflicting priorities

**Human review for stereotypes** before proceeding

### 4. 📊 Collect Scored Feedback (1-10 scale)
Each persona scores 5 dimensions:
1. **Understandability** - Can I grasp the core message?
2. **Style Quality** - Is writing engaging?
3. **Human Voice** - Does this sound person-written or mechanical?
4. **Forward-ability** - Would I share this? (if applicable)
5. **Persuasiveness** - Am I moved by the argument? (if applicable)

Plus qualitative feedback and improvement suggestions

### 5. ⚖️ Apply Weighting
- Target audience: 1.5×
- Accessibility personas: 1.5×
- Skimming reader: 1.3×
- Deep reader: 1.2×

### 6. ✅ Check Hard Requirements
**Must meet ALL:**
- All accessibility personas ≥7 on understandability
- Mean human voice ≥7
- No target/adjacent personas <3 on understandability

### 7. 🔍 Run 5 Mandatory Audits
**A. Accessibility** - Reading level, jargon, structure, neurodivergent access
**B. Authenticity vs. Optimization** - Preserving your voice?
**C. Persuasion Patterns** - Claims properly calibrated? Objections addressed?
**D. Viral Mechanics** - Hooks, shareability (if applicable)
**E. Accuracy & Precision** - Facts checked? Sources cited? (for factual content)

### 8. ✏️ Revise Content
**Priority order:**
1. Manipulation/accuracy (VETO)
2. Accessibility barriers (requirement)
3. Authenticity preservation (bias toward authentic voice)
4. Understandability gaps
5. Human voice
6-8. Optimization (forward-ability, style, persuasiveness)

### 9. 🔄 Iterate or Converge
**Converge when:**
- All hard requirements met
- Scores stable (±10%) across 2 iterations
- No major revisions needed
- Authenticity not declining

**Stop early if:**
- Authenticity declining (over-optimization backfiring)
- Diminishing returns

**Iteration cap:** 4 iterations max

### 10. 📝 Document
Track: Updated content, persona feedback, weight calculations, audit findings, changes made with rationale

---

## Example: Quick Blog Post Optimization

**Original:** "AI will revolutionize software development. Developers must adapt or become obsolete."

### Iteration 1 Feedback:
- **ADHD reader (4)**: "Too alarmist. Makes me anxious, can't focus on actual advice."
- **Skeptic (3)**: "What about AI limitations? This feels like hype."
- **Human voice (mean 5.5)**: "Sounds like LinkedIn thought leadership. Where's your experience?"

### Revised:
"I've been using LLMs for coding daily for 6 months. Here's what I've learned about what's changing and what's not..."

[Acknowledges AI limitations, shares personal experience, less alarmist tone]

### Iteration 2 Results:
- ADHD reader (7): "Much better. Specific examples I can follow."
- Skeptic (7): "Balanced take. I can engage with this."
- Human voice (8.2): "Now it sounds like you!"
- **Convergence achieved**

---

## Critical Reminders

### ⚠️ IMPRD Optimizes Communication, NOT Truth
- Convergence ≠ your argument is correct
- Convergence = diverse readers understand your message
- Still need fact-checking, domain expertise, real debate

### 🌍 Cultural Scope: Western English-Language Only
IMPRD embeds Western assumptions:
- Direct communication (vs. high-context)
- Individual persuasion (vs. collective discernment)
- Viral spread as success (vs. relational engagement)

**For non-Western contexts:** Adapt significantly or don't use

### ♿ Accessibility is Requirement, Not Optional
~20-30% of audiences have accessibility needs
- If inaccessible, content is broken
- All accessibility personas must score ≥7 understandability
- Weighted 1.5× (prioritized)

### 🎭 Preserve Authentic Voice
Over-optimization erodes what makes you distinctive
- Document voice characteristics upfront
- Bias toward authenticity when conflicts arise
- Stop early if authenticity declining

### 🚫 Manipulation Audit Has Veto Power
Cannot optimize false/manipulative content
- Deception compounds with optimization
- If manipulation audit fails, STOP
- Don't rationalize ("my cause is good" doesn't justify manipulation)

## Common Pitfalls (Quick List)

1. ❌ Treating convergence as truth validation
2. ❌ Over-optimizing for viral spread (loses authenticity)
3. ❌ Skipping manipulation audit ("I'm not manipulative")
4. ❌ Assuming AI personas = real audiences
5. ❌ Ignoring minority reports from accessibility personas
6. ❌ Optimizing for wrong audience
7. ❌ Over-optimization eroding voice (stop if authenticity declining)

## FAQ (Quick Answers)

**Q: Can I skip steps to go faster?**
A: No. Manipulation audit (Step 1) and mandatory audits (Step 7) are required. Skipping risks harm.

**Q: What if I disagree with persona feedback?**
A: Question: Is this person wrong, or am I in a bubble? Often personas surface your blindspots. If consistently disagreeing, check your openness.

**Q: Can I use for persuading people to my political view?**
A: Yes, IF you pass manipulation audit (factually accurate, acknowledges trade-offs, respects autonomy). Not for propaganda or deception.

**Q: My accessibility personas want simplification but I need technical precision. Which wins?**
A: Accessibility. Find way to be both accessible AND precise (define terms, use examples, structure clearly). If impossible, make technical version and separate accessible summary.

**Q: Can I hire someone to run IMPRD for me?**
A: Yes, but they need access to your distinctive voice/goals. Works best when creator involved in iteration process.

**Q: Is this just "make AI read my blog post"?**
A: No. IMPRD is *systematic methodology* with ethical safeguards, required diversity, weighted aggregation, multiple audits, and iteration criteria. Just asking AI "how's my post?" misses most value and risks.
