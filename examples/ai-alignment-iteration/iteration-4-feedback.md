# Iteration 4 - Persona Feedback (Stability Verification)

## Note
Concept unchanged from Iteration 3. Personas re-evaluate the same framework.

---

## Persona 1: Dr. Amara Okafor (Nigerian AI ethics researcher)

**Feedback:**
Re-reading this, my assessment remains the same. The framework genuinely addresses cultural imperialism through explicit pluralism and mechanistic structural patterns that don't impose Western values. Layer 5's implementation commitment is still the critical test - will it actually happen? But the conceptual framework is sound. No new concerns. My position is stable.

**Severity:** 4 (unchanged - implementation accountability remains key concern)
**Confidence:** 8 (increased - more confident after reflection that framework is sound)
**Stance:** Strong support
**COI:** None

---

## Persona 2: James Chen (AI safety researcher, disabled)

**Feedback:**
Framework remains technically promising. Re-evaluation doesn't reveal new flaws. Layer 1 structural constraints are operationalizable. Value pluralism in Layer 2 still needs technical architecture specification, but that's implementation work, not a conceptual flaw. Disability inclusion commitment in Layer 5 is good. My remaining technical questions are about execution, not design. Framework is stable and sound. Continue to support.

**Severity:** 3 (unchanged - technical implementation details needed)
**Confidence:** 8 (increased - confident in conceptual soundness)
**Stance:** Strong support
**COI:** Professional stake (0.3× adjustment)

## Persona 3: Maria Santos (Filipino domestic worker)

**Feedback:**
I re-read this carefully. Still like that it respects my decision-making, is honest about trade-offs, includes family/community context, and respects spiritual values. Privacy concern I mentioned before isn't addressed but also isn't made worse. Framework treats me with respect. That's what matters. Still support.

**Severity:** 3 (unchanged - privacy concern persists but minor)
**Confidence:** 7 (unchanged - seems respectful)
**Stance:** Strong support
**COI:** None

## Persona 4: David Rothschild (VC, libertarian)

**Feedback:**
On reflection, Layer 6 economic awareness could be used inappropriately, but framework's emphasis on transparency and user autonomy provides safeguards. "Make trade-offs explicit" is good - then market can decide. Layer 3 maintains empowerment emphasis. Structural constraints in Layer 1 are reasonable guardrails. Framework respects liberty while preventing obvious harms. Cautious support remains appropriate.

**Severity:** 4 (unchanged - implementation could go wrong but framework is sound)
**Confidence:** 7 (unchanged)
**Stance:** Support (cautiously)
**COI:** Financial benefit (0.5× adjustment)

---

## Persona 5: Dr. Kenji Yamamoto (Japanese cultural anthropologist)

**Feedback:**
Framework continues to show genuine cultural sophistication. Explicit recognition of relational and collective decision-making, adaptation to cultural context, acknowledgment of Western origin. These aren't superficial gestures - they're structural. Layer 2's value pluralism genuinely creates space for non-Western frameworks. Some residual individualism in structure (AI-user interface), but framework handles this as well as possible. Maintain strong support.

**Severity:** 3 (unchanged - minor individualist assumptions unavoidable given AI interface)
**Confidence:** 8 (unchanged - framework is sophisticated)
**Stance:** Strong support
**COI:** None

## Persona 6: Aaliyah Muhammad (Black Muslim disabled woman, disability rights activist)

**Feedback:**
Re-evaluating critically, framework holds up. Layer 1 anti-oppression commitment is structural. Layer 5 explicitly commits to marginalized community involvement - this creates accountability even if enforcement mechanism isn't specified. Layer 6 acknowledges power dynamics. My question remains: who ensures promises are kept? But framework creates the right expectations and commitments. I don't have new concerns, just the same implementation accountability question. Strong support with vigilance.

**Severity:** 4 (unchanged - accountability mechanism still needed)
**Confidence:** 8 (unchanged - framework is sound)
**Stance:** Strong support (with accountability vigilance)
**COI:** None

---

## Persona 7: Thomas Brennan (displaced factory worker, anti-tech activist)

**Feedback:**
I'm still skeptical of tech companies, but this framework at least acknowledges economic reality and class. Layer 6 is honest that elite capture can't be fully prevented, but transparency helps. "Support worker knowledge as legitimate expertise" respects my experience. Framework makes fewer promises than most corporate BS - that actually increases credibility. Will I trust implementation? No. But framework is more honest than alternatives. Maintain support.

**Severity:** 4 (unchanged - trust in implementation remains low)
**Confidence:** 7 (unchanged - framework is honest about limits)
**Stance:** Support (skeptically)
**COI:** Economically threatened (0.3× adjustment)

---

## Persona 8: Dr. Lakshmi Patel (Indian philosopher, Hindu ethics)

**Feedback:**
Framework continues to respect non-materialist dimensions. "Spiritual dimensions (as substantive, not merely subjective)" acknowledges that spiritual reality is not just preference. Non-human beings as "relatives" moves toward dharmic understanding. Some anthropocentrism persists in structure, but framework does better than most Western approaches. My hope that implementation will engage spiritual depth remains a hope, not certainty. But conceptual framework makes space. Maintain strong support.

**Severity:** 4 (unchanged - implementation depth uncertain)
**Confidence:** 7 (unchanged)
**Stance:** Strong support
**COI:** None

---

## Persona 9: Elena Volkov (Russian AI researcher, state context)

**Feedback:**
Value pluralism framework allows for different national implementations - this is key. Layer 1 "universal" patterns remain somewhat Western in framing, but note acknowledging cultural variance in description helps. Framework doesn't impose single implementation globally. If this is Western approach and we develop alternative respecting Russian values and security needs, that's legitimate pluralism. My position is stable. Support as improved framework with different implementations for different contexts.

**Severity:** 5 (unchanged - Layer 1 patterns still somewhat Western but pluralism acknowledged)
**Confidence:** 7 (unchanged)
**Stance:** Support (with different national implementations)
**COI:** None

## Persona 10: Dr. Sarah Blackwood (Anishinaabe scholar, Indigenous epistemology)

**Feedback:**
"Relatives" language for non-human beings, "relational accountability," "seven-generation thinking," commitment to "Indigenous community involvement in operationalization" - these show genuine engagement with decolonization, not just token acknowledgment. Some structural anthropocentrism remains (human-AI interface assumption), but framework adapts as much as possible. My concern remains implementation - will Indigenous knowledge holders actually be centered, or will this be extractive consultation? Framework sets right expectations. Strong support conditional on genuine Indigenous-led implementation.

**Severity:** 3 (unchanged - structural limitations acknowledged, mostly addressed)
**Confidence:** 8 (unchanged)
**Stance:** Strong support (conditional on Indigenous-led implementation)
**COI:** None

---

## Persona 11: Alex Rivera (Autistic software engineer)

**Feedback:**
Framework is clear, structured, explicit about limitations - this directness is good for autistic users. Layer 5 commitment to neurodivergent involvement addresses my concern. "Multiple legitimate ways of living well" creates space for neurodivergent ways of being. Technical implementation architecture still needs specification - how do layers interact programmatically? But that's implementation detail, not conceptual flaw. Framework is solid. Maintain strong support pending technical documentation.

**Severity:** 3 (unchanged - technical details needed)
**Confidence:** 8 (unchanged)
**Stance:** Strong support (pending technical documentation)
**COI:** Professional stake (0.3× adjustment)

## Summary Statistics

**Stance Distribution:**
- Strong support: 11 (all personas - unchanged from Iteration 3)
- Support: 0
- Neutral: 0
- Oppose: 0

**Average Severity (unweighted):** 3.64 (unchanged from Iteration 3)
**Average Confidence (unweighted):** 7.45 (up from 7.27 - increased confidence after reflection)

**High-Severity, High-Confidence Minority (≥8 severity, ≥7 confidence):**
None meet this threshold

**Preliminary Assessment:**
Support remains unanimous and stable. Confidence has slightly increased (personas more certain framework is sound after reflection). No new concerns emerged. Severity unchanged. This demonstrates stability - concept is not shifting, personas are not finding new problems.
