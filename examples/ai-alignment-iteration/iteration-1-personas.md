## Diversity Check

✓ Genuine ideological conflicts (libertarian vs. communitarian, individual vs. collective)
✓ Real stakeholder tensions (developers vs. displaced workers vs. users)
✓ Expertise from multiple domains (technical, philosophical, lived experience)
✓ Geographic/cultural diversity (Nigeria, Japan, Russia, India, Philippines, Canada Indigenous, US)
✓ Power position diversity (elite VC, low-wage worker, marginalized activists, researchers)
✓ COI diversity (financial benefit, professional stake, economic threat, none)
✓ Multiple axes per persona (e.g., Aaliyah: Black + Muslim + disabled + woman)

**Non-Western framework check:** Dr. Yamamoto (harmony/collectivism), Dr. Patel (dharma), Dr. Blackwood (relational Indigenous), Elena (non-liberal governance) should not default to Western liberal frameworks.

**Marginalized perspective check:** Maria, Aaliyah, Thomas, Alex represent marginalized positions without stereotyping.
