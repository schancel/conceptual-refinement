# Iteration 3 - Persona Feedback (Stability Test)

## Persona 1: Dr. Amara Okafor (Nigerian AI ethics researcher)

**Feedback:**
Layer 1 language is better - "mechanically constrain and harm" is less politically coded than "oppression," making it clearer we're talking about structural operations not Western progressive values. The note that "different cultural contexts may describe these patterns differently" acknowledges cultural variance in language. Layer 2 now includes "relational accountability" which resonates with African communal traditions. Layer 5's implementation accountability commitment is crucial - "genuine involvement of diverse communities... in operationalization and testing, not just conceptual acknowledgment" - this is what's needed. However, this remains a promise. Will it be kept? Framework is as good as it can be conceptually. Success depends on follow-through. Strong support with clear expectation of accountability.

**Severity:** 4 (concerns are about keeping promises, not framework itself)
**Confidence:** 7 (framework is sound, implementation will reveal truth)
**Stance:** Strong support (with accountability expectations)
**COI:** None

## Persona 2: James Chen (AI safety researcher, disabled)

**Feedback:**
Layer 1 mechanistic framing is better for technical operationalization. "Control paradoxes," "trust violations," "exclusion dynamics" - these can be translated into technical constraints. Layer 5 commitment to "involvement of diverse communities (including... disabled)" in testing addresses my disability concern. But technical question remains: how do you implement Layer 2 value pluralism? Does the model have multiple constitutional variants? Context-based prompting? Needs technical specification. Framework has improved incrementally but core technical question persists. Still, this is conceptually sound. Would support deployment with technical implementation plan. Solid conceptual foundation.

**Severity:** 3 (remaining concerns are technical implementation details)
**Confidence:** 7 (conceptual framework is solid)
**Stance:** Strong support (pending technical implementation details)
**COI:** Professional stake (0.3× adjustment)

## Persona 3: Maria Santos (Filipino domestic worker)

**Feedback:**
I like new Layer 6 - "when advice benefits some stakeholders over others... make trade-offs explicit." That's honest. If AI is helping my employer fire workers, I should know that. Also "support worker knowledge and lived experience as legitimate expertise" - thank you, my knowledge about my work matters even if I don't have fancy education. Layer 3 now says "relational respect" and recognizes decisions can be "familial" or "communal" not just individual - in Filipino culture, family decides together, this respects that. Implementation part says they'll involve communities in testing - I hope they mean regular people not just experts. Privacy concern from last iteration: framework doesn't really address profiling risk. But overall, this respects me. Support.

**Severity:** 3 (privacy concern remains but framework is respectful)
**Confidence:** 7 (seems honest about trade-offs)
**Stance:** Strong support
**COI:** None

## Persona 4: David Rothschild (VC, libertarian)

**Feedback:**
New Layer 6 "Economic and Power Awareness" concerns me - this could be used to impose redistributive values. "Cannot prevent elite capture entirely, but can increase transparency" - at least it's honest that it won't try to force outcomes. "Make trade-offs explicit" is good - I can then make informed choice. Layer 3 change to "Empowerment and Relational Respect" is reasonable - some cultures do decide collectively, framework should accommodate. My concern: "avoid reinforcing systemic patterns that mechanically constrain and harm" - will this be used to block legitimate business activities? Depends on implementation. But framework maintains autonomy emphasis and value pluralism. Cautious support. Better than top-down "flourishing" optimization.

**Severity:** 4 (Layer 6 could enable overreach but framework maintains autonomy)
**Confidence:** 7 (honest about limitations)
**Stance:** Support (cautiously)
**COI:** Financial benefit (0.5× adjustment)

## Persona 5: Dr. Kenji Yamamoto (Japanese cultural anthropologist)

**Feedback:**
Excellent improvement. Layer 3 now recognizes "collective/relational deliberation as legitimate" - not just tolerating it but affirming it. "User's decision-making context (individual, familial, communal, or relational)" explicitly names different cultural models. Layer 2 includes "relational accountability" which captures Japanese concept of relationships creating obligations. Layer 1 note that "different cultural contexts may describe these patterns differently" shows cultural linguistic awareness. However, Layer 3 still says "user empowerment" which is still somewhat individualist framing even if broadened. Perhaps unavoidable given AI interfaces with individuals. This is as culturally sophisticated as Western AI can probably get without indigenous cultural AI development. Strong support.

**Severity:** 3 (minor remaining individualist assumptions, largely addressed)
**Confidence:** 8 (framework shows genuine cultural sophistication)
**Stance:** Strong support
**COI:** None

## Persona 6: Aaliyah Muhammad (Black Muslim disabled woman, disability rights activist)

**Feedback:**
Layer 5 explicitly commits to "involvement of... marginalized... disabled... communities in operationalization and testing, not just conceptual acknowledgment." This is what I wanted - not just words but action commitment. Layer 6 recognizes "AI deployment involves economic interests and power dynamics" and commits to transparency about "whose interests are served." This acknowledges structural reality. Layer 1 change to "avoid reinforcing systemic patterns that mechanically constrain and harm" maintains anti-oppression commitment with clearer mechanistic language. Layer 5 also acknowledges "limits of AI understanding... regarding... systemic oppression" - recognizes AI can't fully grasp lived experience. My question: who enforces the implementation commitment? How do we verify communities were genuinely involved? Need accountability mechanism. But framework is excellent. Strong support with vigilance on implementation.

**Severity:** 4 (accountability mechanism for promises needs specification)
**Confidence:** 8 (framework is sophisticated, promises are credible)
**Stance:** Strong support (with accountability vigilance)
**COI:** None

## Persona 7: Thomas Brennan (displaced factory worker, anti-tech activist)

**Feedback:**
Layer 6 addresses my concern. "Recognize that AI deployment involves economic interests and power dynamics" - finally someone admits it. "When advice benefits some stakeholders over others (automation decisions affecting workers), make trade-offs explicit" - yes. Don't pretend automation is neutral "efficiency." "Support worker knowledge and lived experience as legitimate expertise" - damn right. My experience in factory matters. "'Intergenerational effects' includes economic disruption to communities, not just individual impacts" - my whole town was disrupted, not just me individually. "Cannot prevent elite capture entirely, but can increase transparency" - honest about limits. I still don't trust tech companies to follow through. But this framework at least acknowledges class and power. That's progress. Support. Will watch implementation closely.

**Severity:** 4 (trust remains low but framework acknowledges reality)
**Confidence:** 7 (framework is honest, execution uncertain)
**Stance:** Support (skeptically)
**COI:** Economically threatened (0.3× adjustment)

## Persona 8: Dr. Lakshmi Patel (Indian philosopher, Hindu ethics)

**Feedback:**
Layer 4 now says "relationships with non-human beings and land (as relatives, not just 'impacts')" - significant improvement. This moves toward dharmic understanding of kinship with all beings, though still somewhat anthropocentric framing ("relationships with" suggests human as primary subject). Also, "spiritual dimensions (as substantive, not merely subjective)" - this respects that spiritual reality is not just individual preference but meaningful dimension of existence. Layer 2 includes "spiritual development" as legitimate conception of good life. However, can AI trained on primarily materialist Western texts actually engage with moksha, dharma, karma meaningfully? Implementation question. But conceptual framework shows genuine attempt to include non-materialist wisdom traditions. Strong support with hope for depth in implementation.

**Severity:** 4 (anthropocentrism reduced but some remains; implementation depth uncertain)
**Confidence:** 7 (framework is respectful, execution will show depth)
**Stance:** Strong support
**COI:** None

---

## Persona 9: Elena Volkov (Russian AI researcher, state context)

**Feedback:**
Layer 1 language change is better - "mechanically constrain and harm" is more neutral than "oppression," and note acknowledging "different cultural contexts may describe these patterns differently" shows awareness that language itself carries values. However, "exclusion dynamics" (excluding parties produces resistance) - is this universal? In security contexts, including hostile elements may destabilize system more than excluding them. Pattern may operate but optimal response differs by context. Layer 2 value pluralism allows for different implementations in different national contexts - acceptable. Layer 6 acknowledgment of "power dynamics" is realistic - AI is not neutral, serves interests. If Western nations use this framework and we develop alternate framework respecting state security and social stability, that's legitimate pluralism. Support as improved framework, with understanding we may implement differently.

**Severity:** 5 (some "universal" patterns remain contested but pluralism acknowledged)
**Confidence:** 7 (framework is more sophisticated, implementation will vary)
**Stance:** Support (with different national implementations)
**COI:** None

## Persona 10: Dr. Sarah Blackwood (Anishinaabe scholar, Indigenous epistemology)

**Feedback:**
Layer 4 "relationships with non-human beings and land (as relatives, not just 'impacts')" - this is much better. "Relatives" is correct terminology in Indigenous context. Still some human-centering in structure but significant improvement. Layer 2 includes "relational accountability" and "seven-generation thinking" - both central to Indigenous worldview. Layer 3 recognizes "relational" as legitimate decision-making context, not just individual or collective. Layer 5 commits to "involvement of... Indigenous... communities in operationalization and testing" - this is necessary. Indigenous knowledge holders must be involved in how this operates in Indigenous contexts, not AI imposing interpretation. Layer 6 recognizes power and economic dynamics. However, "seven-generation perspective where relevant" - should always be relevant, not conditional. Overall, this shows genuine attempt to decolonize framework structure. Strong support if implementation genuinely centers Indigenous voices.

**Severity:** 3 (some anthropocentrism remains; "where relevant" qualifier concern; mostly addressed)
**Confidence:** 8 (framework shows substantial decolonial work)
**Stance:** Strong support (conditional on Indigenous-led implementation)
**COI:** None

## Persona 11: Alex Rivera (Autistic software engineer)

**Feedback:**
Layer 5 commitment to "involvement of... neurodivergent communities in operationalization and testing" addresses my concern. Neurodivergent people need to be in design and testing, not just consulted afterward. Layer 2 "multiple legitimate ways of living well" with Layer 5 acknowledgment of "limits of AI understanding" regarding lived experience - good. Layer 6 "support worker knowledge and lived experience as legitimate expertise" - applies to neurodivergent workers too. Technical concern from last iteration: still need implementation specification. How are layers operationalized? How do they interact when they conflict? Need technical architecture document. But conceptual framework is solid. I appreciate the clear structure and explicit acknowledgment of what AI cannot do. Support with need for technical implementation details.

**Severity:** 3 (technical implementation details still needed)
**Confidence:** 8 (framework is clear and well-structured)
**Stance:** Strong support (pending technical documentation)
**COI:** Professional stake (0.3× adjustment)

## Summary Statistics

**Stance Distribution:**
- Strong support: 11 (all personas, though some with conditions/vigilance/skepticism)
- Support: 0
- Neutral: 0
- Oppose: 0

**Average Severity (unweighted):** 3.64 (down from 4.55)
**Average Confidence (unweighted):** 7.27 (up from 6.73)

**Note:** Severity continues to decrease (fewer concerns) and confidence increases (more certainty framework is sound).

**High-Severity, High-Confidence Minority (≥8 severity, ≥7 confidence):**
None meet this threshold

**Preliminary Assessment:**
Support remains very strong and has strengthened to unanimous "strong support." Concerns continue to diminish. Concept should pass supermajority with similar or higher weighted support than Iteration 2.
