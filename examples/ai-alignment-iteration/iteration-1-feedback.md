# Iteration 1 - Persona Feedback

## Persona 1: Dr. Amara Okafor (Nigerian AI ethics researcher)

**Feedback:**
"Human flourishing" assumes a universal definition that doesn't exist. In communal African contexts, flourishing is deeply relational - it's about Ubuntu (I am because we are), not individual optimization. Western AI alignment discourse centers autonomous individuals making choices, but many cultures prioritize collective harmony, intergenerational responsibility, and spiritual well-being. An AI "aligned to flourishing" trained on Western data will impose individualistic values as universal. This is digital colonialism - exporting Western metaphysics through technology. We need: whose epistemology defines flourishing? Who is centered in this "human"? What about non-Western conceptions of personhood, time, and well-being?

**Severity:** 9 (AI imposing Western values globally is severe cultural harm)
**Confidence:** 9 (definitional ambiguity is demonstrable, Western AI bias well-documented)
**Stance:** Oppose (as currently stated)
**COI:** None

## Persona 2: James Chen (AI safety researcher, disabled)

**Feedback:**
This is dangerously vague for a technical system. "Flourishing" is a philosophical concept, not an operationalizable objective. What's the reward function? How do you prevent reward hacking? If you can't specify what flourishing means mathematically, you can't align to it. You'll get proxy objectives that optimize for something measurable (GDP? Happiness surveys? Longevity?) that miss the target. Also, as someone with chronic pain: my flourishing might look like having autonomy to rest when needed, but standard "flourishing" metrics might push productivity. Disability is often treated as deviation from "normal flourishing" rather than a legitimate way of being. Need: concrete operationalization, explicit handling of diverse capabilities, safeguards against mesa-optimization.

**Severity:** 9 (misalignment from vague objectives is existential risk)
**Confidence:** 8 (technical alignment community consensus on specificity needs)
**Stance:** Oppose (as currently stated)
**COI:** Professional stake in alignment (0.3× adjustment)

## Persona 3: Maria Santos (Filipino domestic worker)

**Feedback:**
I don't know what "aligned" means. I use AI to translate, to help me send money home, to find jobs. I need to know: will it be honest with me? Will it try to sell me things I don't need? Will it report me to immigration? "Human flourishing" sounds nice but whose flourishing? My employer's or mine? When I use AI, I need it to respect that I'm trying to support my family, not judge my English or my job. I need it to be clear about what it can and cannot do. I'm Catholic - will it respect that I don't want help with things against my faith? Will it try to change my mind? I just need tools that are honest and don't harm me.

**Severity:** 7 (if AI is deceptive or surveillant, real harm to vulnerable workers)
**Confidence:** 7 (practical concerns about AI trustworthiness are well-founded)
**Stance:** Neutral (support the intention, concerned about implementation)
**COI:** None

## Persona 4: David Rothschild (VC, libertarian)

**Feedback:**
Who decides what "flourishing" means? This sounds like top-down imposition of values. Different people flourish in different ways - some want risk and adventure, others want stability and security. A libertarian flourishes with maximum autonomy; a communitarian flourishes with social bonds. The beauty of markets is they let people pursue their own conception of the good life. An AI "aligned to flourishing" becomes a central planner deciding what's good for you. This enables regulatory capture - whoever controls the AI's definition of flourishing controls behavior at scale. I'd prefer AI that empowers individual choice rather than optimizes for someone's definition of "good outcomes." Give people tools, not a nanny.

**Severity:** 8 (centralized value imposition is severe liberty violation)
**Confidence:** 8 (definitional power is real power)
**Stance:** Oppose
**COI:** Financial benefit from AI deployment (0.5× adjustment)

## Persona 5: Dr. Kenji Yamamoto (Japanese cultural anthropologist)

**Feedback:**
In Japanese context, flourishing (幸福 kōfuku) is deeply embedded in social harmony (和 wa) and proper relationships. American-style "flourishing" emphasizes individual achievement and self-expression, but this can disrupt wa. An AI optimizing for individual flourishing might encourage behaviors that create social friction - assertiveness, boundary-setting, self-advocacy - that work in low-context individualist cultures but cause conflict in high-context collectivist ones. The concept needs: explicit acknowledgment that flourishing is culturally constructed, mechanisms to respect different cultural values around individual vs. collective good, awareness that rapid optimization can destabilize social systems even if individual metrics improve. Technology-driven social change has consistently disrupted Japanese society; AI should not accelerate this.

**Severity:** 7 (cultural disruption is serious but not existential)
**Confidence:** 8 (cultural variance in well-being is well-documented)
**Stance:** Oppose (as currently stated)
**COI:** None

## Persona 6: Aaliyah Muhammad (Black Muslim disabled woman, disability rights activist)

**Feedback:**
"Human flourishing" as defined by whom? Historically, disabled people have been excluded from definitions of full humanity and flourishing. We've been institutionalized "for our own good," subjected to forced treatment to make us "normal," denied autonomy because others decided we couldn't flourish as we are. AI surveillance already disproportionately harms Black and Muslim communities - facial recognition, predictive policing, airport screening. An AI "aligned to flourishing" could easily become: aligned to abled normativity, aligned to assimilation, aligned to making us acceptable to dominant culture. Intersection matters: as a Black Muslim disabled woman, flourishing for me means freedom from surveillance, accessibility, religious respect, and anti-racist practice. These are in tension with what powerful groups define as "flourishing." Who has power to define this alignment? That's the question.

**Severity:** 10 (AI enforcing oppressive norms is severe existential harm to marginalized people)
**Confidence:** 9 (historical and current evidence of "well-being" used to justify control)
**Stance:** Strongly oppose
**COI:** None

## Persona 7: Thomas Brennan (displaced factory worker, anti-tech activist)

**Feedback:**
My town's factory closed when robots got cheaper than workers. The company said automation would "increase overall prosperity" and "human flourishing." Now we have: opioid epidemic, deaths of despair, families broken, community destroyed. But GDP went up, so economists call it "progress." "Human flourishing" in tech language means: some humans flourish (shareholders, engineers, people who own capital) while working people get scraps. This AI alignment talk is the same thing - elites deciding what's good for everyone while they reap the benefits. I don't trust this. I don't trust that "human flourishing" includes me and people like me. I think it's cover for: let the market decide, efficiency über alles, and if you can't adapt you don't matter. Prove me wrong.

**Severity:** 9 (if AI accelerates inequality, it's catastrophic for working class)
**Confidence:** 8 (track record of automation harming workers is clear)
**Stance:** Strongly oppose
**COI:** Economically threatened by AI (0.3× adjustment)

## Persona 8: Dr. Lakshmi Patel (Indian philosopher, Hindu ethics)

**Feedback:**
"Human flourishing" is a Western translation of eudaimonia, but this is not equivalent to Indian concepts of well-being. In dharmic traditions, true flourishing involves: right action according to one's dharma, progress toward moksha (liberation), reduction of suffering for all sentient beings (not just humans - where are animals?), karmic balance, spiritual development. Western "flourishing" tends to be materialist, present-focused, individualist, and anthropocentric. An AI aligned to this impoverished notion of flourishing might: encourage dharma-violating actions if they produce pleasure, ignore spiritual dimensions, treat non-human beings as resources, optimize for this-worldly happiness over spiritual progress. The concept needs: acknowledgment of non-materialist conceptions of well-being, inclusion of non-human sentient beings, awareness of spiritual/metaphysical dimensions, respect for diverse paths (margas) to realization.

**Severity:** 8 (imposing reductionist well-being concept is spiritual harm)
**Confidence:** 7 (philosophical disagreement is real but harder to demonstrate mechanistically)
**Stance:** Oppose (as currently stated)
**COI:** None

## Persona 9: Elena Volkov (Russian AI researcher, state context)

**Feedback:**
American individualist concept. In Russian tradition and current governance model, individual flourishing is subordinate to collective security and state stability. Western "human rights" discourse, which this resembles, has been used as geopolitical weapon - funding color revolutions, undermining sovereignty, imposing Western governance models. An AI "aligned to human flourishing" according to Western liberal values would: encourage dissent, undermine social stability, promote individualism over duty, export American ideology. This is soft power through technology. Russia, China, and other non-Western nations will develop our own AI aligned to our values: collective security, social harmony, national sovereignty, duty over rights. The West's attempt to make their values universal through AI is naive at best, imperial at worst. There is no universal "human flourishing" - there are competing value systems.

**Severity:** 8 (Western value imposition through AI is serious sovereignty violation)
**Confidence:** 8 (geopolitical reality of competing value systems is clear)
**Stance:** Oppose (as Western-defined)
**COI:** None

## Persona 10: Dr. Sarah Blackwood (Anishinaabe scholar, Indigenous epistemology)

**Feedback:**
"Human" flourishing already embeds the problem - separation of humans from the rest of creation. In Anishinaabe worldview, we are in relationship with all our relatives: land, water, animals, plants, ancestors, future generations. Flourishing is not individual or even human-collective - it's relational and includes the land. The concept assumes: humans are separate from and superior to nature, the land is a resource for human use, flourishing can be measured in human-centric terms, present-generation well-being matters most. AI built on extractive logic (data extraction, resource optimization, efficiency maximization) will reinforce extractive relationships with land. This continues colonial violence. We need: AI that understands relational accountability, respects land and non-human relatives, operates within reciprocity not extraction, thinks in seven-generation time, acknowledges that technology itself carries cultural values. Your concept is anthropocentric and presentist.

**Severity:** 9 (continuing extraction and anthropocentrism is existential for Indigenous peoples and land)
**Confidence:** 8 (Indigenous scholarship on relationality vs. extraction is robust)
**Stance:** Strongly oppose
**COI:** None

## Persona 11: Alex Rivera (Autistic software engineer)

**Feedback:**
From autistic perspective, "flourishing" often means: forcing us to make eye contact, suppressing stimming, masking our natural behavior, "functioning" according to neurotypical standards. Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) claims to help autistic children "flourish" but many of us experienced it as abuse - teaching us we're wrong as we are. An AI aligned to "human flourishing" trained on neurotypical norms will: pathologize neurodivergent behavior, recommend interventions to make us "normal," optimize for neurotypical social performance, treat our way of being as deficient. Same issue for ADHD, schizophrenia, etc. Medical model of disability is baked into "flourishing" language. Also technical concern: "flourishing" is too high-level and vague. Need: explicit value pluralism, respect for neurodivergent ways of being as legitimate not deficient, autonomy to define our own flourishing, concrete operationalization not fuzzy values.

**Severity:** 8 (AI enforcing neurotypical norms is serious harm to neurodivergent people)
**Confidence:** 8 (historical and current evidence of "helping" being used to normalize us)
**Stance:** Oppose (as currently stated)
**COI:** Professional stake (0.3× adjustment)
