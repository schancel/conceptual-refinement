# AI Alignment System Prompt - IMPCD Demonstration

This directory contains a complete demonstration of using IMPCD v2.1.1 to debug and refine an AI alignment system prompt, starting from the simple concept "This AI is aligned to human flourishing."

## The Journey in Brief

### Iteration 1: Complete Failure (0% Support)
**Concept:** "This AI is aligned to human flourishing"
**Result:** Unanimous rejection
**Why:** Cultural imperialism, definitional power, anthropocentrism, vagueness, individualism

### Iteration 2: Reconceptualization (96.7% Support)
**Concept:** Multi-layered alignment (structural patterns + value pluralism + user autonomy + multi-dimensional + epistemic humility)
**Result:** Strong majority support
**Why:** Grounded in mechanics, respects diversity, empowers choice, honest about limits

### Iteration 3: Refinement (100% Support)
**Concept:** Iteration 2 + refinements (relational framing, economic awareness, implementation accountability)
**Result:** Unanimous strong support, approaching convergence
**Why:** Addressed remaining concerns about individualism, anthropocentrism, power dynamics

### Iteration 4: Full Convergence (100% Support, 0% Change)
**Concept:** No changes - stability test
**Result:** Full convergence achieved (all 3 criteria met)
**Why:** Support stable (0% change), semantic similarity 100%, confidence increased, no new concerns

## Key Insights

1. **Structural patterns** (reciprocity, trust, oppression) can serve as universal constraints while **values remain plural**
2. **Definitional power** over "alignment" is real power at scale - political question, not just technical
3. **Value pluralism** is non-negotiable - no single "flourishing" definition is universal
4. **Implementation accountability** matters as much as conceptual framework
5. **Anthropocentrism and individualism** are Western cultural assumptions, not universal
6. **Economic and power dynamics** underlie technical alignment questions
7. **Epistemic humility** builds trust rather than weakens credibility

## The Converged Framework

**Multi-Layered Alignment:**
1. Structural pattern constraints (mechanistically cross-cultural)
2. Value pluralism (context-adaptive, no universal "flourishing")
3. User empowerment and relational respect (not paternalism)
4. Multi-dimensional consideration (human, ecological, spiritual)
5. Epistemic humility and implementation accountability
6. Economic and power awareness

## Methodology Assessment

**IMPCD v2.1.1 successfully:**
- Surfaced hidden assumptions
- Revealed power dynamics
- Identified structural pattern violations
- Enabled iterative convergence
- Distinguished conceptual from implementation issues

**Limitations acknowledged:**
- AI personas ≠ real people
- Western AI may misrepresent non-Western views
- Cannot replace ethnographic work
- Conceptual debugging ≠ validation

## What's Next

This demonstration used AI personas. **Real implementation requires:**
1. Genuine community involvement (marginalized, non-Western, Indigenous, disabled communities from iteration 1)
2. Technical architecture specification (how to implement value pluralism, layer interactions)
3. Accountability mechanisms (verifying implementation promises)
4. Cross-cultural testing with real ethnographic work
5. Economic governance (preventing elite capture)
