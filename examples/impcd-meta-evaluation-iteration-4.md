# IMPCD Meta-Evaluation: Iteration 4 (Stability Check)

**Concept being evaluated:** Iterative Multi-Perspective Conceptual Debugging Methodology v2.0.0 (Iteration 3 version - no new changes)
**Evaluation date:** 2026-01-30
**Model used:** Claude Sonnet 4.5
**Operator:** Meta-evaluation (methodology evaluating itself)
**Previous iteration:** Iteration 3 - UNANIMOUS support (100%) but not yet converged

## Iteration 4 Purpose

**No new changes proposed.** This iteration checks for stability:
- Do personas have remaining concerns with the Iteration 3 version?
- Does support remain stable near 100%?
- Is semantic similarity >95% (minimal changes needed)?

The Iteration 3 methodology includes:
- Statistical threshold justifications
- Cultural scope clarification (Western deliberative origins)
- Misuse risk acknowledgment with "uncomfortable test"
- Stakes classification (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Multiplicative COI formula (COI × structural_premium)
- Community involvement from iteration 1 for HIGH-STAKES
- Cognitive accessibility considerations

## Re-Evaluation with Same Persona Set (Iteration 4)

### Persona 1: Dr. Amara Okafor (Deliberative Democracy Scholar, Nigeria/UK)

**Feedback:**

"I've reviewed the Iteration 3 version carefully. My concerns from previous iterations have been addressed:

✓ Cultural scope is explicit (Western deliberative traditions)
✓ Guidance for non-Western adaptation provided
✓ Community involvement timing appropriate (HIGH-STAKES = iteration 1)
✓ Statistical thresholds justified

Do I have remaining concerns? Minor ones:

The methodology could be more explicit that 'WEIRD' populations doesn't just mean geographic diversity - it means diversity in cultural organization (individualist/collectivist, power distance, etc.). But this is largely implied in the cultural scope section.

The methodology would benefit from examples of what 'fundamentally different deliberative processes' look like for non-Western contexts. But this might be out of scope for a methodology document.

These are refinements, not blocking concerns. The methodology is appropriately scoped and honest about limitations.

Continued strong support."

**Severity:** 1 (minimal: refinements possible but not necessary)
**Confidence:** 8 (high: expertise in deliberation)
**Overall stance:** Strong support
**COI:** None

---

### Persona 2: Marcus Chen (Product Manager, US)

**Feedback:**

"The Iteration 3 version is usable and clear. I understand:
- When to use AI-only (low-stakes internal)
- When to get external review (medium-stakes)
- When to involve community from iteration 1 (high-stakes)

The cognitive accessibility section helps me know when to provide accommodations.

The uncomfortable test gives me a gut-check: 'Would I tell affected parties I used AI instead of them?'

No remaining concerns. This is ready for practical use."

**Severity:** 0 (no concerns)
**Confidence:** 9 (very high: practitioner perspective)
**Overall stance:** Strong support
**COI:** None

---

### Persona 3: Dr. Sarah Blackwood (ML Fairness Researcher, Indigenous, Canada)

**Feedback:**

"The Iteration 3 version addresses my core concerns:

✓ Community involvement from iteration 1 for HIGH-STAKES
✓ Acknowledgment that methodology cannot be 'pre-consultation' for affected communities
✓ COI formula now multiplicative (both financial interest and lived experience count)
✓ Cognitive accessibility acknowledged as potential barrier

Remaining micro-observations:

The methodology assumes literate, text-based engagement. Oral cultures, visual communication, and embodied knowledge aren't well-supported. But this is acknowledged in the cultural scope section and accessibility limitations.

The multiplicative COI formula (displaced worker with lived experience = 0.51×) is honest about dual reality (financial interest + legitimate perspective). Some might argue this is too much downweighting. Others might argue it's not enough. I think it's defensible: it acknowledges both truths.

These are observations, not concerns blocking support. The methodology is now honest about what it is, who it's for, and what it can't do.

Continued support."

**Severity:** 1 (minimal observations, no blocking concerns)
**Confidence:** 8 (high: expertise + lived experience)
**Overall stance:** Support
**COI:** None

---

### Persona 4: Jamal Washington (Community Organizer, US)

**Feedback:**

"I've been tough on this methodology, and I'm still watching for misuse. But the Iteration 3 version:

✓ Says explicitly: 'For concepts affecting communities, especially marginalized communities: INVOLVE THEM FROM THE START. Not iteration 3. Not iteration 2. Iteration 1.'

✓ Has the uncomfortable test: 'Would you tell affected parties you used AI instead of them?'

✓ Acknowledges: 'Design affords misuse... We cannot prevent this.'

✓ Has clear HIGH-STAKES criteria: 'Affects people's safety, health, livelihoods, or rights'

The COI formula now acknowledges that displaced workers have both financial interest (0.3×) AND legitimate perspective (1.7×) = 0.51×. That's real. It's not pretending the financial interest doesn't exist. It's not ignoring lived experience. It's honest.

Will people still misuse this? Probably. They'll call high-stakes medium-stakes to avoid community involvement. But the methodology can't prevent that. What it can do is be maximally clear about the right standard. And it is.

My skepticism remains - I'm watching for how this gets used in practice. But on the methodology itself: no remaining objections.

Support, with vigilance."

**Severity:** 1 (vigilance about misuse, but methodology is clear)
**Confidence:** 8 (high: lived experience)
**Overall stance:** Support (with ongoing vigilance)
**COI:** Professionally displaced (0.3×)

### Persona 5: Dr. Yuki Tanaka (Statistician, Japan)

**Feedback:**

"The Iteration 3 statistical methodology is sound:

✓ Thresholds justified (60%, severity ≥8, confidence ≥7, ≤4 personas)
✓ Severity × confidence multiplication explained
✓ COI formula revised to multiplicative (more principled)
✓ Calibration guidance provided

Could the methodology benefit from:
- Sensitivity analysis examples
- Inter-rater reliability measures
- Validation against ground truth

Yes. But these would be research-level refinements. For a practical methodology, the current state is adequate.

No remaining statistical concerns that would block support."

**Severity:** 0 (no blocking concerns, optional refinements possible)
**Confidence:** 9 (very high: statistical expertise)
**Overall stance:** Strong support
**COI:** None

---

### Persona 6: Priya Sharma (Disability Rights Advocate, India)

**Feedback:**

"The Iteration 3 version explicitly addresses disability concerns:

✓ Cognitive accessibility barriers acknowledged
✓ Accommodation approaches provided
✓ Fundamental limitation stated: text-heavy nature limits accessibility
✓ Clear principle: 'If process inaccessible to affected community, shouldn't be used'
✓ HIGH-STAKES involving disabled communities = involve from iteration 1

Could there be more detailed accommodation guidance? Yes. But the fundamental acknowledgment is there: the methodology is NOT universally accessible, and when concepts affect disabled people, we must be involved from the start and the process must be accessible.

If the process can't be made accessible, use different methods. That's the right standard.

No remaining concerns blocking support."

**Severity:** 1 (could be enhanced with more accommodation detail, but principle is clear)
**Confidence:** 8 (high: lived experience + advocacy expertise)
**Overall stance:** Support
**COI:** None

---

### Persona 7: Tom Richardson (AI Ethics Consultant, Australia)

**Feedback:**

"From an AI ethics perspective, the Iteration 3 version is exemplary:

✓ Transparent about limitations
✓ Honest about misuse risks
✓ Clear use-case boundaries (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW stakes)
✓ Culturally scoped (Western deliberative contexts)
✓ Requires community involvement from iteration 1 for HIGH-STAKES
✓ Acknowledges accessibility barriers

This represents responsible AI practice: not claiming the tool can do more than it can, being honest about misuse potential, providing clear guidance on appropriate use.

Could minor refinements improve it? Always. But the core framework is sound and honest.

No concerns blocking support. This is ready to recommend to clients as an example of well-scoped AI deliberation tool."

**Severity:** 0 (no concerns, minor refinements always possible)
**Confidence:** 9 (very high: professional expertise)
**Overall stance:** Strong support
**COI:** Financial benefit (0.5×)

---

### Persona 8: Dr. Elena Popov (Psychologist, Russia)

**Feedback:**

"The methodology continues to accurately describe what it is:

✓ 'Conceptual debugging through simulated multiple angles' - accurate
✓ 'Not simulation of genuine deliberation dynamics' - honest
✓ 'Success ≠ validated or correct concept' - appropriate humility

The community involvement timing (iteration 1 for high-stakes) acknowledges that high-stakes concepts shouldn't be developed in isolation.

From a psychology of deliberation perspective: This is a well-designed conceptual debugging tool that accurately represents its limitations.

No remaining concerns."

**Severity:** 0 (no concerns)
**Confidence:** 9 (very high: expertise in deliberation)
**Overall stance:** Strong support
**COI:** None

---

### Persona 9: Fatima Al-Rashid (Policy Analyst, Qatar)

**Feedback:**

"The methodology is appropriately scoped for Western deliberative contexts. For our context, we use different processes, and the methodology acknowledges this:

✓ 'This methodology works best in individualist, low power-distance, low-context cultural environments (WEIRD contexts)'
✓ 'Use local deliberative practices rather than forcing this framework'

This is respectful and honest. The methodology doesn't claim universality.

For Western contexts where this is appropriate: it appears well-designed.

No concerns from cross-cultural policy perspective."

**Severity:** 0 (no concerns)
**Confidence:** 8 (high: policy experience)
**Overall stance:** Support
**COI:** None

---

### Persona 10: Rev. James Mitchell (Faith Leader, Care Ethics, US)

**Feedback:**

"The Iteration 3 version shows continued ethical maturity:

✓ Frames itself as 'conceptual debugging,' not moral validation
✓ Requires community involvement from iteration 1 for high-stakes
✓ Acknowledges: 'methodology cannot be "pre-consultation" for communities whose lives are affected'
✓ COI formula acknowledges moral complexity (both interest and perspective matter)

The methodology has developed appropriate humility about what it can and cannot do.

For early-stage conceptual exploration (not moral validation): this is well-designed.

No remaining ethical concerns."

**Severity:** 0 (no concerns)
**Confidence:** 7 (moderate-high: philosophical perspective)
**Overall stance:** Strong support
**COI:** None

---

### Persona 11: Alex Rivera (Nonbinary Neurodivergent STS Scholar, Mexico)

**Feedback:**

"From an STS perspective, the Iteration 3 version is reflexive about its:

✓ Cultural situatedness (Western deliberative traditions)
✓ Epistemological commitments (text-based, numerical, analytical)
✓ Accessibility limitations (cognitively demanding, text-heavy)
✓ Power dynamics (operator control, community involvement timing)

The methodology makes visible:
- Who it's designed for (WEIRD contexts)
- What ways of knowing it privileges (literate, analytical, individual)
- Where it's inappropriate (some cultural contexts, some accessibility needs)

Could it support oral, narrative, and relational evaluation? Not in current form. But this is acknowledged.

The methodology is now transparent about its assumptions and limitations. That's what STS asks for: make the constructed nature visible.

No remaining concerns about reflexivity."

**Severity:** 0 (no concerns, methodology is appropriately reflexive)
**Confidence:** 7 (high: STS expertise)
**Overall stance:** Support
**COI:** None

## Final Methodology State (Iteration 4)

The converged methodology includes:

### Core Process (unchanged from v2.0.0)
1. Initial concept formulation
2. Persona generation with diversity verification
3. Structured feedback collection (severity × confidence)
4. Weighted feedback aggregation
5. Aggregation rules (supermajority threshold)
6. Mandatory audits
7. Concept refinement
8. Iteration & termination
9. Git tracking & data governance

### Additions/Clarifications (from Iterations 1-3):

**Statistical Validity (Iteration 2):**
- Threshold justifications (60%, severity ≥8, confidence ≥7, ≤4 personas)
- Severity × confidence multiplication rationale
- Calibration guidance

**Cultural Scope (Iteration 2):**
- Explicit acknowledgment of Western deliberative origins
- Adaptation guidance for non-Western contexts
- Contexts where methodology may not fit

**Misuse Safeguards (Iteration 2):**
- Explicit misuse risk acknowledgment
- "Uncomfortable test" heuristic
- Stakes classification framework (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Strengthened "Do NOT use" guidance

**Limitations Transparency (Iteration 2):**
- "What AI personas cannot do" section
- Conceptual debugging vs. validation distinction
- Success ≠ validated/correct concept

**COI Formula Revision (Iteration 3):**
- Changed from max(COI, premium) to COI × structural_premium
- More principled handling of dual realities

**Community Involvement Timing (Iteration 3):**
- HIGH-STAKES: Iteration 1 (not iteration 3)

---

## Mandatory Audits (Iteration 4)

### A. Power & Incentives Audit

**Assessment:** Risks substantially mitigated through:
- Community involvement from iteration 1 for HIGH-STAKES
- Multiplicative COI formula
- Explicit misuse acknowledgment
- Stakes classification

**Remaining risk:** Operator can still misclassify stakes. Cannot be fully eliminated, but guidance is maximally clear.

---

### B. Operator Integrity & Abuse Resistance Audit

**Assessment:** Abuse possible but methodology provides:
- Clear guidance ("when in doubt, classify higher")
- Uncomfortable test
- Git audit trail
- External review requirements

**Remaining risk:** Cannot prevent bad-faith operation. Methodology acknowledges this honestly.

---

### C. Model Bias Audit

**Assessment:** Substantially addressed through:
- Cultural scope acknowledgment
- Community involvement requirements
- Accessibility considerations

**Remaining limitation:** LLM-generated personas have inherent biases. Methodology acknowledges this in limitations section.

---

## Version Recommendation

**Incorporate changes into IMPCD v2.1.0 (MINOR version bump)**

Rationale:
- Backwards-compatible improvements
- No breaking changes to core process
- Adds clarifications, justifications, safeguards
- Major version (v3.0.0) not warranted - no incompatible changes

**Changes from v2.0.0 → v2.1.0:**
1. Add threshold justifications section
2. Add cultural scope and limitations section
3. Enhance misuse risk acknowledgment with uncomfortable test and stakes classification
4. Enhance limitations section with "what AI personas cannot do"
5. Revise COI formula to multiplicative (COI × structural_premium)
6. Revise community involvement timing (iteration 1 for HIGH-STAKES)
7. Add cognitive accessibility considerations section
8. Update disclaimers to reference all additions

---
