# Templates

This directory contains fill-in-the-blank scaffolds and structured formats for specific use cases.

## What is a Template?

A template is a pre-structured format that provides:
- **Specific fields** to fill in
- **Prompts** for what to include in each section
- **Formatting conventions** for consistency
- **Examples** of completed templates

Templates are most useful when you need consistency across multiple applications of the same pattern or methodology.

## Template Structure

Each template should include:

1. **Purpose**: What this template is for
2. **When to Use**: Situations requiring this template
3. **The Template Itself**: Clearly marked fields with instructions
4. **Filled Example**: At least one complete example
5. **Validation Checklist**: How to verify you've completed it correctly

## Existing Templates

### Documentation Templates

- **[Threshold Documentation Template](threshold-documentation-template.md)** - 7-element template for documenting nonlinear threshold effects and tipping points (pattern name, mechanism, quantitative/qualitative estimate, evidence level, reversibility, warning indicators, premium justification)

## Contributing

When adding a new template:
- Use clear, descriptive filenames (e.g., `threshold-documentation-template.md`)
- Mark all fillable fields clearly (e.g., `[YOUR ANSWER HERE]`)
- Provide guidance for each field
- Include at least one fully-worked example
