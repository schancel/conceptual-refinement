# Threshold Documentation Template

## Purpose

This template ensures comprehensive documentation of nonlinear threshold effects and tipping points in systems. Use this when documenting patterns where systems remain stable until a critical point, then transition rapidly.

## When to Use

Use this template when:
- Documenting patterns with threshold/tipping-point behavior
- Effects are irreversible or very costly to reverse
- Harm is disproportionate after the threshold
- System behavior changes qualitatively at the threshold

Examples: trust collapse, ecological regime shifts, cultural extinction, reputation collapse, inequality thresholds, network effects

## The Template

### 1. Pattern Name
**[Name of the pattern exhibiting threshold behavior]**

Example: "Trust collapse in organizational relationships"

---

### 2. Threshold Mechanism
**What triggers the phase transition?**

[Describe the mechanism that causes the system to shift from one stable state to another]

Example: "Repeated violations of expectations create cumulative doubt; trust remains stable through minor violations but collapses when violations exceed capacity for repair or signal fundamental unreliability."

---

### 3. Threshold Estimate

**Quantitative (STRONGLY PREFERRED):**
- Specific value or range: [NUMBER or RANGE]
- Units: [UNITS]
- Research source: [CITATION]
- Confidence interval (if available): [RANGE]

**OR Qualitative (only if quantitative unavailable):**
- Trigger conditions: [DESCRIPTION]
- Observable signals: [WHAT TO LOOK FOR]
- **Mark clearly:** "QUALITATIVE ESTIMATE - quantitative research needed"

Examples:
- Quantitative: "~3-4 major trust violations in professional context (Source: Dirks 2009)"
- Quantitative: "Amazon deforestation threshold ~40% (Source: Lovejoy & Nobre 2018)"
- Qualitative: "Trust collapse triggered when perceived pattern of deception + perception that complaints are ignored + no corrective action"

---

### 4. Evidence Level
**Select one:**
- [ ] **Provisional**: LLM assessment, no citations → premium range 1.3×–1.5× only
- [ ] **Validated**: Citations provided for threshold existence → premium range 1.3×–1.7×
- [ ] **Highly Validated**: Robust cross-cultural evidence + quantitative estimates → premium range 1.5×–2.0×

**Supporting evidence:**
[List citations, studies, cross-cultural validation, quantitative data sources]

---

### 5. Reversibility
**Can the system recover after crossing the threshold?**

- Recovery possible: [YES/NO/PARTIAL]
- Recovery cost: [VERY LOW / LOW / MODERATE / HIGH / VERY HIGH / IMPOSSIBLE]
- Recovery timeframe: [SPECIFIC TIMEFRAME or "Unknown"]
- Recovery requirements: [WHAT IS NEEDED TO REVERSE]

Example: "Partial recovery possible but requires 3-5× the effort of initial trust-building; reputation never fully recovers to baseline (Source: Dirks 2009)"

---

### 6. Warning Indicators
**What signals precede the threshold crossing?**

List observable early-warning signs:
1. [Indicator 1]
2. [Indicator 2]
3. [Indicator 3]

Example:
1. Increased skepticism of neutral statements
2. Seeking external verification of previously-trusted claims
3. Reduced voluntary information sharing
4. Pattern of excuses rather than acknowledgment

---

### 7. Premium Justification
**Why does this threshold warrant higher weighting?**

Address:
- Irreversibility or recovery cost
- Disproportionate harm after threshold
- Early-stage prevention opportunity
- Evidence strength supporting the threshold
- Pattern validation tier

Example: "Premium 1.7× justified because: (a) trust collapse is largely irreversible in organizational contexts (partial recovery at 3-5× cost), (b) preventable with early intervention, (c) Validated tier with citations, (d) quantitative threshold estimates available."

---

## Validation Checklist

Before finalizing, verify:
- [ ] All 7 elements are completed
- [ ] Quantitative estimates provided if available in literature
- [ ] If qualitative, explicitly marked as such with justification
- [ ] Evidence level matches supporting citations (Provisional/Validated/Highly Validated)
- [ ] Premium justification aligns with evidence level
- [ ] Warning indicators are observable and actionable
- [ ] Reversibility accurately represents research/evidence
- [ ] For Highly Validated + culturally-specific: ethnographic corroboration included

## Example: Complete Threshold Documentation

### 1. Pattern Name
**Organizational trust collapse**

### 2. Threshold Mechanism
Repeated violations of expectations create cumulative doubt. Trust remains stable through minor violations but collapses when violations exceed capacity for repair or signal fundamental unreliability about future behavior.

### 3. Threshold Estimate
**Quantitative:** ~3-4 major trust violations in professional organizational contexts (Source: Dirks et al. 2009; Kim et al. 2004)

**Note:** Threshold varies with violation severity, relationship history, and alternatives available. Lower for high-stakes contexts.

### 4. Evidence Level
**Validated** - Multiple studies in organizational contexts with consistent threshold ranges.

Supporting evidence:
- Dirks, K. T., Lewicki, R. J., & Zaheer, A. (2009). Repairing relationships within and between organizations
- Kim, P. H., et al. (2004). Removing the shadow of suspicion: The effects of apology versus denial

### 5. Reversibility
- Recovery possible: PARTIAL
- Recovery cost: HIGH (3-5× the effort of initial trust-building)
- Recovery timeframe: 6 months to 2+ years depending on severity
- Recovery requirements: Consistent contrary evidence, acknowledgment, systemic changes, time, often never fully recovers to baseline

### 6. Warning Indicators
1. Increased skepticism of neutral/positive statements
2. Seeking external verification of previously-trusted information
3. Reduced voluntary information sharing
4. Attribution shift: attributing problems to intent rather than circumstance
5. Reduced benefit-of-the-doubt in ambiguous situations

### 7. Premium Justification
Premium 1.7× justified because:
- Trust collapse is largely irreversible (partial recovery at high cost)
- Preventable with early intervention when warning indicators appear
- Validated tier with consistent cross-study findings
- Quantitative threshold estimates available from multiple studies
- Disproportionate long-term organizational harm relative to intervention cost
