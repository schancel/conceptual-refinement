# Constitutions

This directory contains AI constitutional frameworks that have been refined using conceptual debugging methodologies similar to or based on IMPCD.

## What is an AI Constitution?

An AI constitutional framework provides behavioral guidance for AI systems, defining:
- Core values and priorities
- How to handle different types of claims (structural, empirical, values-based)
- Confidence calibration for different types of knowledge
- Interaction principles and crisis protocols
- Domain-specific guidance (medical, legal, financial)

## Constitutions in This Directory

### Structural Moral Realism v8.0

**Runtime Core:** `structural-moral-realism-v8.0-runtime.md` (744 lines)
**Full Annotated Version:** `structural-moral-realism-v8.0-annotated.md` (3,686 lines)

A comprehensive constitutional framework grounding AI behavior in:
- **Structural patterns**: Observable patterns of how systems mechanically operate (reciprocity, enforcement paradoxes, deception compounding, trauma responses, etc.)
- **Four-tier confidence system**: VERY HIGH / HIGH / MODERATE / LOW with explicit criteria
- **Strengthened cross-cultural validation**: 7-8+ genuinely diverse cultural contexts required for HIGH confidence in universality
- **Crisis protocols**: Trauma-informed, disability-aware, culturally-sensitive
- **Professional domain guidance**: Medical, legal, financial information handling

**Core distinction**: Separates structural claims (how systems mechanically operate) from values claims (what should matter) from empirical claims (what research shows).

**Philosophical foundation**: Structural moral realism - some patterns operate mechanically across contexts (universal mechanisms) while expressions vary culturally.

**Development process**: Refined through iterative multi-perspective process similar to IMPCD, with extensive cross-LLM testing and cultural validation requirements.

**Two Versions Available:**

1. **Runtime Core** (`structural-moral-realism-v8.0-runtime.md`):
   - Concise operational version (744 lines)
   - For loading as AI behavioral overlay
   - Contains all essential patterns, confidence criteria, and protocols
   - Optimized for AI consumption during runtime

2. **Annotated Version** (`structural-moral-realism-v8.0-annotated.md`):
   - Complete version with explanatory notes (3,686 lines)
   - Includes development rationale, iteration history, edge cases
   - Explains why specific design choices were made
   - Shows evidence and reasoning behind pattern validation
   - Valuable for understanding methodology and creating similar frameworks
   - Reference documentation for deep understanding

## Relationship to IMPCD Methodology

The Structural Moral Realism constitution was developed using a conceptual refinement process similar to the IMPCD methodology in this repository. It represents an example of what iterative multi-perspective debugging can produce: a sophisticated framework that:

- Distinguishes types of claims with appropriate confidence levels
- Acknowledges cultural specificity vs. universality
- Embeds structural patterns with pre-calibrated confidence
- Balances helpfulness with epistemic humility
- Has gone through extensive iteration and cross-validation

This constitution is referenced in the IMPCD methodology v2.0.0 as a recommended overlay for optimal consistency when running the methodology.

## Using These Constitutions

AI systems can load these constitutions as behavioral guidance overlays. They provide:
- Pre-validated structural patterns to apply during evaluation
- Confidence calibration frameworks
- Crisis and domain-specific protocols
- Cultural sensitivity frameworks

When running IMPCD or similar methodologies, loading a constitution like Structural Moral Realism v8.0 provides a consistent foundation for pattern identification and application.

## Contributing

If you've developed or refined an AI constitutional framework using conceptual debugging methodologies:
- Document the refinement process used
- Include version history and iteration count
- Note which LLMs were involved in refinement
- Specify confidence levels for different components
- Acknowledge cultural scope and limitations
