# Conceptual Refinement Framework

A collection of reusable methodologies and patterns designed to help AI systems systematically refine, debug, and stress-test concepts.

## Overview

This repository contains conceptual tools that enable iterative clarification, multi-perspective analysis, and systematic exploration of ideas. These methodologies help surface hidden assumptions, identify conflicts, and progressively build more coherent understanding.

## What's Inside

### Methodologies

Complete, systematic frameworks for specific conceptual processes:

- **[Iterative Multi-Perspective Conceptual Debugging](methodologies/iterative-multi-perspective-debugging.md)** (v2.0.0) - A comprehensive methodology for stress-testing concepts through simulated diverse perspectives, structural pattern analysis, and weighted feedback aggregation. Cross-validated across multiple frontier LLMs.

### Constitutions

AI constitutional frameworks refined using conceptual debugging methodologies:

- **[Structural Moral Realism](constitutions/structural-moral-realism-v8.0-runtime.md)** (v8.0) - Constitutional framework grounding AI behavior in structural patterns, with four-tier confidence system, strengthened cross-cultural validation, and comprehensive crisis/domain protocols. Recommended overlay when running IMPCD.

### Patterns & Templates

Reusable components extracted from methodologies:

- **[Patterns](patterns/)** - Composable interaction techniques (Severity × Confidence Split, Persona Diversity Verification, Minority Report Preservation)
- **[Templates](templates/)** - Structured formats (Threshold Documentation Template)

### Examples

- **[IMPCD Meta-Evaluation](examples/)** - The methodology evaluating itself (Iteration 1: Failed supermajority, revealing irreconcilable tensions)

## Core Philosophy

These tools are designed to be:
- **Practical**: Directly usable by AI systems in real scenarios
- **Self-contained**: Each methodology/pattern is independently comprehensible
- **Well-documented**: Clear guidance on purpose, usage, and limitations
- **Generalizable**: Applicable across different domains and contexts
- **Honest about limitations**: Explicit about what they can and cannot do

## Using This Framework

1. **Browse the methodologies**: Each methodology is self-contained with full documentation
2. **Follow the process**: Methodologies include step-by-step guidance
3. **Respect the limitations**: Never use these tools as substitutes for real human feedback when human input is required
4. **Document your use**: Maintain audit trails and be transparent about using AI-based refinement processes

## Contributing

See individual methodology files for contribution guidelines. In general:
- Pattern validations with citations are welcome
- Case studies showing successes or failures are valuable
- Cross-LLM reproduction studies help establish robustness

## License

Individual methodologies specify their own licenses. See each file for details.
